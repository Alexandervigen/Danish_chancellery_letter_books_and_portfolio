```{r}
library(ggplot2)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Defining a function to extract the lengths of the pdf's
```{r}
pdf_length <- function(path) {
  qpdf::pdf_length(path)
}
```

A data frame is created in which the pagecounts of the pdf's are assigned to each year. The code below has been created with the aid of chatGPT: 
```{r}
pdf_files <- list.files(path = "data/brevbøger_opdelt", pattern = "\\.pdf$", full.names = TRUE)

data <- data.frame(Year = integer(), Pages = integer())

for (file in pdf_files) {
  year <- as.numeric(gsub("\\.pdf$", "", basename(file)))
  
  page_count <- pdf_length(file)
  data <- rbind(data, data.frame(Year = year, Pages = page_count))
}
```

A scatterplot is created with an overlying graph created using the "loess" method: 
```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = Year, y = Pages)) +
  geom_line(color = "steelblue") +
  geom_point(color = "darkred") +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", span = 0.3, se = FALSE, color = "forestgreen", linetype = "solid") +
  labs(
    title = "Number of Pages per Year in Danish Chancellery Letter Books (1550–1660)",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Number of Pages"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() 
```
